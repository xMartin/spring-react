# Spring Boot with ReactJS example setup

Check second commit to see what's been added to the starter project.

Run `./gradlew bootRun` (on Unix-like systems) and check generated files in `/src/main/resources/static/`.

For frontend development you can set up a watch task in your IDE running `npm run webpack` (have nodejs installed on your system) in the project directory to build the client-side application.
